            "Adults and adolescents older than 19 years:  A dose of 20 µg of antigen protein in 1 mL is recommended in a 0, 1, 6 month schedule.\n",
            "13  Adolescents:  In adolescents from the age of 10 years, up to and including 19 years, a 10 µg dose is  recommended provided the immunisation is carried out in the 0, 1, 6 month schedule, in  circumstances which will ensure compliance to the full vaccination course.\n",
            "If compliance cannot  be assured, then a 20 µg dose should be used to increase the proportion of participants protected  after the first and second doses.\n",
            "The 20 µg vaccine can also be used in participants from 11 years up to and including 15 years of  age in a 0 and 6 month schedule in situations when there is a relatively low risk of hepatitis B  infection during the vaccination course and when compliance with the complete vaccination course  can be anticipated.\n",
            "Neonates, infants and children below 10 years of age:    A dose of 10 µg of antigen protein in 0.5 mL suspension is recommended in a 0, 1, 6 months  schedule.\n",
            "In adults, the injection should be given in the  deltoid region but it may be preferable to inject ENGERIX-B in the anterolateral thigh in neonates  and infants because of the small size of their deltoid muscle.\n",
            "14  Vaccination Schedules  For primary vaccination of adults, adolescents and children not previously exposed to the hepatitis  B virus, the schedules are as follows:  ______________________________________________________________________________   Vaccine dose Initial 1 month* 6 months*                                        ______________________________________________________________________________  Adults and adolescents over 20 µg 1 mL 1 mL  1 mL  19 years  Adolescents from 10 up to 10 µg 0.5mL 0.5mL  0.5mL  and including 19 years ‡  Adolescents from 11 years 20 µg 1 mL -  1 mL  up to and including 15 years   of age #  Neonates∇ and children  10 µg 0.5mL 0.5mL  0.5mL  younger than 10 years  ______________________________________________________________________________  * after first dose  ‡  if compliance cannot be assured a 20µg dose should be used.\n",
            "#  The 20 µg vaccine may be administered in participants from 11  years up to and including 15 years of age  according to a 0,6 months schedule.\n",
            "However, in this case, protection against hepatitis B infections may not  be obtained until after the second dose (see Clinical Pharmacology).\n",
            "Therefore this schedule should be  used only when there is a relatively low risk of hepatitis B infection during the vaccination course and when  completion of the two-dose vaccination course can be anticipated.\n",
            "The recommended treatment regimen for infants born to HBsAg positive mothers  (irrespective of the mother’s HBeAg status) is as follows:  _______________________________________________________________________________   Vaccine Dose At birth 1 month* 6 months*                                        _______________________________________________________________________________  ENGERIX-B vaccine  10 µg 0.5mL 0.5mL    0.5mL  Hepatitis B Immunoglobulin      - 100 IU      -        -  (HBIG)  _______________________________________________________________________________  * after first dose   15  The first dose of vaccine and immunoglobulin should preferably be given within 12 hours of birth at  separate sites.\n",
            "Accelerated schedules  In circumstances where more rapid protection is required (e.g. contacts of carriers, immunisation of  travellers and newborns to carrier women) two accelerated vaccination schedules of 0, 1 and 2  months or 0, 7 and 21 days may be used.\n",
            "However, as higher seroprotective rates are observed  following the 0, 1, 2 month schedule, it is recommended the 0, 7, 21 day schedule be administered  only to adults, and only in exceptional circumstances (e.g travellers commencing hepatitis B primary  vaccination within one month of departure).\n",
            "(see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY)  Since the peak  antibody levels reached after these shorter schedules of primary vaccination are lower compared to  the 0, 1 and 6 month schedule, it is recommended that a fourth dose (booster) be given at 12  months after the first dose of vaccine, in order to ensure adequate seroprotection rates.\n",
            "Chronic adult haemodialysis patients/Patients with impaired renal function (creatinine  clearance <30 mL/min) 16 years of age and above  The primary vaccination schedule for chronic adult haemodialysis patients or patients with impaired  renal function 16 years of age and above consists of four doses of 40µg.\n",
            "_______________________________________________________________________________   Vaccine dose Initial 1 month* 2 months* 6months*                                              _______________________________________________________________________________  Chronic haemodialysis or 40 µg 2mL 2mL 2mL 2mL  Impaired renal function  patients  _______________________________________________________________________________  * after first dose  As vaccine-induced protection in haemodialysis patients is less complete, boosting should be  adapted in order to ensure the anti-HBs antibody titre remains above 10IU/L (see  PRECAUTIONS).\n",
            "16  Post-exposure prophylaxis  There are no adequately controlled studies on the effectiveness of hepatitis B immunoglobulin  administration, along with the vaccine, in adults and older children exposed to hepatitis B virus  through 1) needlestick, ocular or mucous membrane exposure to blood known or presumed to  contain HBsAg; 2) human bites by known or presumed HBsAg carriers that penetrate the skin;  3)  following intimate sexual contact with known or presumed HBsAg carriers.\n",
            "Booster dose  The NHMRC recommends that booster doses against hepatitis B are not required in  immunocompetent individuals, since there is good evidence that a completed primary course of  hepatitis B vaccination provides long lasting protection in these individuals.\n",
            "The timing  for boosting in these individuals should be decided by regular monitoring of hepatitis B antibody  levels at six to twelve monthly intervals.\n",
